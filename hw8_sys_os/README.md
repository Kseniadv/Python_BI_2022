### Homework to modules sys and os

To run files without specifying an absolute path, you need to put the directory where they are in PATH by command:

`export PATH="[path to dirrectory]:$PATH"`

1. `wc.py` coun lines and words in file and count size of file in bites.

    `wc.py -l` count lines in file

    `wc.py -w` count words in file

    `wc.py -c` count size of file

This version program doesn't take standard input.

2. `ls` print the contents of a directory

    `ls -a` print also hidden files and directories, but this option doesn't work in this version

3. `sort` sorts the contents of a file or directory

4. `rm` remove file or directory

    `rm -r` remove directory and its contents recursively

5. `mv` move file or directory

6. `cp` copy file or the contents directory

    `cp -r` copy the contents of directory recursively
