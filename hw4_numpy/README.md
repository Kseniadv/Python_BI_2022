Task for numpy

This code contains some functions where we use the numpy package.

1. Function **matrix_multiplication** takes 2 matrices and multiplies them.
2. Function **multiplication_check** takes list of matrix and check the possibility of their multiplication. Return **True** or **False**.
3. Function **multiply_matrices** takes list of matrix and multiply them if possible. Return multiplication result or 'None' if we can't multiply matrices.
4. Function **compute_2d_distance** takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with a pair of values (as coordinates of a point on a plane). Calculating the distance between them. Return distance.
5. Function **compute_multidimensional_distance** takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with any number of values (but equal). Calculating the distance between them. Return distance.
6. Function **compute_pair_distances** takes two-dimensional arrays where each row is an observation and each column is a feature. The function calculates the matrix of pairwise distances. Return distance.
